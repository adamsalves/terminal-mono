{{- /* The markdown twin of a post, published next to it as index.md.

       Two things want this. A reader that is an answer engine gets the source
       without having to strip a page's chrome back off it, and a citation that
       lands here lands on the same words the HTML shows rather than on a
       reconstruction of them.

       The metadata is a plain list rather than a YAML front-matter block. This
       file is read as prose by a model, not parsed by a static-site generator,
       and fenced front matter is a delimiter the reader has to know about
       before the first line means anything.

       .RawContent, not .Plain, for the reason llms-full.txt gives: headings,
       lists and code fences are the structure, and .Plain is what is left over
       after throwing them away. */ -}}

       exclusion means nothing if the excluded text ships beside it in markdown.
