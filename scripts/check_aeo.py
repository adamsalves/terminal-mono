"""Assert the AEO output of a built site: robots.txt and the JSON-LD graph.

Everything this checks fails silently. A robots.txt whose Sitemap line points at
a file that is not in the build still serves 200. A JSON-LD block with a typo in
it still renders — a crawler skips it and the page looks perfect to a human. An
`author` that references an @id no node defines is a graph with a hole in the
middle of it, and no browser will ever say so.

So the build is the fixture and the assertions are the review:

  robots.txt   one Sitemap line, naming a file the build actually published;
               every group carries at least one rule; the four crawlers aeo.js
               calls major are allowed; and an indexable build contains no bare
               `Disallow: /`, which is the line that would silently switch the
               whole site off.

  JSON-LD      every block parses; every page carries a publisher and a WebSite;
               posts carry a BlogPosting with the fields that make it one; every
               @id a node references is defined by a node on the same page; and
               a BreadcrumbList counts 1..n with no gaps and no self-link on its
               last crumb.

  llms.txt     one per language, each starting with an H1 and naming its own
               llms-full.txt; and — the one that matters — every link in it
               resolves to a file the build actually published. A link that
               404s is the failure mode of an index nobody renders and no
               browser ever opens.

  markdown     every post publishes the index.md twin llms.txt links to, and
               that file names the post's own URL back. A twin that points at
               a different page is worse than no twin: a citation follows it.

The three [outputs]-dependent halves can be switched off for a site that never
declared them: --no-robots, --no-llms, --no-markdown. Nothing else is optional —
the JSON-LD needs no configuration and so has no flag.

Run: python3 scripts/check_aeo.py <public-dir> [--no-robots] [--not-indexable]
                                                [--no-llms] [--no-markdown]
